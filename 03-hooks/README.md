In React, when you're updating the state using the useState hook, there's a key difference between directly updating the state with the current value and using the functional update form.

Direct Update:

'''setCounter(counter + 1);'''

In this approach, you're using the current state (counter) directly to calculate the next state. This can lead to issues in certain scenarios, especially when state updates are asynchronous.

Functional Update:

'''setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);'''

Here, you're using the functional update form. React guarantees that the prevCounter argument in the function will always have the latest state value. It helps avoid issues related to asynchronous state updates and ensures you are working with the most up-to-date state.

The key distinction is that the functional form takes into account the current state at the time the update is applied, regardless of when the state update is actually executed. It helps in scenarios where state updates might be batched or delayed.

In summary, using the functional update form with setCounter is generally safer, especially in scenarios where you depend on the current state to calculate the next state, and it helps to prevent potential issues related to stale state values.
